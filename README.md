# Pharmaceutical_Sales_Prediction

Pharmaceutical Sales prediction across multiple stores. End-to-end product that delivers this prediction using Flask.

Data used is from kaggle. The product is hosted with heroku.

Precise sales prediction is an essential and inexpensive way for each company to augment their profits, decrease their costs, and achieve greater flexibility to changes. In other words, exact sales forecasting is utilized for capturing the tradeoff between customer demand satisfaction and inventory costs. Especially, for the pharmaceutical industry, successful sales forecasting systems can be very beneficial, due to the short shelf-life of many pharmaceutical products and the importance of the product quality which is closely related to the human health.

In this project, we will forecast the sales of different stores for six weeks.
